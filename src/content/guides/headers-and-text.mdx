# Headers and Text Formatting

This guide covers how to effectively use headers and format text in your Open Docs documentation for maximum readability and engagement.

## Headers

Headers help structure your content and create a clear hierarchy. Open Docs supports 6 levels of headers:

```md
# H1 - Main title of the page
## H2 - Major sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Smaller subsections
##### H5 - Minor points
###### H6 - Fine details
```

### Best Practices for Headers

- Use only one H1 (`#`) per page
- Maintain a logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Keep headers concise and descriptive
- Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word)

## Text Formatting

### Bold, Italic, and Strikethrough

Open Docs supports common text formatting options:

```md
**Bold text** is used for emphasis
*Italic text* is used for slight emphasis or introducing terms
~~Strikethrough~~ is used to show removed or deprecated content
```

Which renders as:

**Bold text** is used for emphasis  
*Italic text* is used for slight emphasis or introducing terms  
~~Strikethrough~~ is used to show removed or deprecated content

### Combining Formatting

You can combine different text formatting styles:

```md
***Bold and italic***
**Bold with *italic* inside**
```

Which renders as:

***Bold and italic***  
**Bold with *italic* inside**

## Links

### Internal Links

Link to other pages in your documentation using relative paths:

```md
[Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation)
[Learn about configuration](/getting-started/configuration)
```

### External Links

Link to external resources by providing the full URL:

```md
[Open Docs GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/open-docs)
[Learn about MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
```

### Section Links

Link to specific sections within a page using anchor links:

```md
[Jump to Text Formatting](#text-formatting)
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for highlighting important information, quotes, or callouts:

```md
> This is a blockquote. It's great for emphasizing important information.
```

Which renders as:

> This is a blockquote. It's great for emphasizing important information.

### Multi-line Blockquotes

```md
> This is a multi-line blockquote.
>
> It can contain multiple paragraphs, lists, and other markdown elements.
>
> - Item one
> - Item two
```

Which renders as:

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
>
> It can contain multiple paragraphs, lists, and other markdown elements.
>
> - Item one
> - Item two

## Callouts and Admonitions

Open Docs supports special callout blocks for different types of information:

```md
<Note>
  This is a note with useful information.
</Note>

<Warning>
  This is a warning that requires attention.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  This is a helpful tip to improve your workflow.
</Tip>

<Info>
  This provides additional context or background information.
</Info>

<Caution>
  This highlights potential issues or pitfalls.
</Caution>
```

## Line Breaks

To create a line break without starting a new paragraph, end a line with two spaces:

```md
This is the first line.  
This is the second line.
```

To create a new paragraph, leave an empty line between text blocks:

```md
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
```

## Code Inline

For inline code references, use backticks:

```md
Use the `<Navigation />` component to add a sidebar.
```

Which renders as:

Use the `<Navigation />` component to add a sidebar.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
```

Which renders as:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2

### Ordered Lists

```md
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Nested step 1
   2. Nested step 2
```

Which renders as:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Nested step 1
   2. Nested step 2

## Horizontal Rules

Use three hyphens to create a horizontal divider:

```md
---
```

Which creates a line like this:

## Tips for Effective Text Usage

1. **Be concise**: Keep paragraphs and sentences short and focused
2. **Use active voice**: It makes your content more engaging and direct
3. **Balance formatting**: Don't overuse bold, italic, or other formatting
4. **Maintain consistency**: Use the same style for similar elements throughout your docs
5. **Consider readability**: Break up large text blocks with headers, lists, and images
