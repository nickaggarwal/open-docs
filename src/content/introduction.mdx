# Introduction to Open Docs

Welcome to Open Docs, a modern documentation site built with React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and MDX. This guide will help you get started with creating your own documentation site.

## What is Open Docs?

Open Docs is a documentation framework that allows you to create beautiful, responsive, and feature-rich documentation websites with ease. It combines the power of React for UI components, TypeScript for type safety, Material UI for styling, and MDX for writing content.

## Key Features

- **MDX Support**: Write documentation in Markdown with JSX components for interactive content.
- **Bootstrap**: Built with React Bootstrap for a polished, responsive UI with pre-built components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code for better developer experience and fewer bugs.
- **Fast & Responsive**: Optimized for speed and works great on all devices and screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in support for light and dark themes.
- **Search**: Full-text search functionality to help users find content quickly.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the look and feel to match your brand.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```md
open-docs/
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts, favicon)
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # React components including navigation config
│   ├── content/          # MDX documentation files
│   │   ├── introduction/
│   │   ├── guides/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   └── resources/
│   ├── config/           # Site Configuration files
│   │   └── site.config.json
│   └── index.tsx         # Application entry point
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Site Configuration


The `site.config.json` file contains the following key configuration options:

- `name`: The name of your documentation site
- `logo`: Path to your site's logo image
- `primaryTab`: Configuration for the main documentation tab
- `tabs`: Array of additional navigation tabs
- `navigation`: Array of sidebar navigation groups and pages
- `favicon`: Path to your site's favicon
- `colors`: Theme color configuration
- `topbarCtaButton`: Configuration for the call-to-action button in the top bar


You can customize all of these options to match your documentation needs. The configuration is automatically applied throughout the site, affecting the theme, navigation, and content organization.


## Writing Documentation

Documentation is written in MDX, which allows you to use Markdown syntax along with JSX components. Here's an example:

```mdx
# My Document

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

<Alert severity="info">
  This is an information alert using Bootstrap component.
</Alert>
```

You can create new MDX files in the `src/content/` directory and add the path in site.config.json `navigation` array.
