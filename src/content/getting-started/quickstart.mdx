This guide will help you install and set up Open Docs for your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git** (optional, but recommended)

## Setting up Docs

### 1. Using the starter template 

The easiest way to get started with Open Docs is to use our starter repo :

<TabGroup>
<Tab title="npm">
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nickaggarwal/open-docs.git my-docs

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-docs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```
</Tab>
</TabGroup>

This will create a new Open Docs project in the `my-docs` directory with all the necessary dependencies and configuration files.

## Configuration

After installation, you may want to configure Open Docs to match your project's needs:

You can start with config folder which has 'site.config.json' file. This file has all the theme and navigation configuration. You can clear the navigation and add your own navigation.

### Customizing the Theme

Configure your site's basic information and branding in the root level of `site.config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Open Docs",
  "logo": "/logo.svg",
  "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
  
  "api": {
    "baseUrl": "https://open-docs.org"
  },
}
```

### Color Customization

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#2E8555",
    "light": "#4CAF50",
    "dark": "#1B5E20"
  },
}


The content folder has sample contnet which you can modify and use or you can detete the folder and create one from scratch. 


## Adding Content

To add new documentation pages:

1. Create a new MDX file in the `src/content/new-page.mdx` directory:

```mdx
# My New Page

This is a new documentation page.

## Section 1

Content for section 1.

## Section 2

Content for section 2.
```

2. Add the page to the navigation configuration in `site.config.json`.

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "pages": [
        ...
        "getting-started/new-page"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Running in Development Mode

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the optimized production build.

## Deployment

1. You can deploy the `build` directory to any static hosting service:
2. You can deploy directly to s3 with npm run deploy command and use it as static website 

### AWS S3

### Prerequisites

1. AWS Account with S3 access
2. AWS CLI installed and configured
3. S3 bucket created and configured for static website hosting

### Deployment 

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

2. Run the below command to push the files to s3:

```bash
# Deploy to S3
npm run deploy
```


## Troubleshooting

For more information on deploying to AWS S3, please refer to the [AWS S3 Deployment Guide](/docs/deployment/aws-deployment).


### Common Issues

#### "Cannot find module" errors

If you encounter "Cannot find module" errors, make sure you have installed all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### TypeScript errors

If you encounter TypeScript errors, make sure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

#### MDX content not loading

If your MDX content is not loading, check your webpack configuration and make sure you have set up the MDX loader correctly.
