Troubleshooting

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm or yarn

## Installation

The quickest way to get started is to use our CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g open-docs-cli
open-docs create my-documentation
cd my-documentation
```

## Start the development server

Once installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Add your first document

Create a new file in the `content` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p content/guides
touch content/guides/my-first-guide.mdx
```

Add some content to your new file:

```mdx
# My First Guide

This is my first guide created with Open Docs.

## Features

- **Easy to use**: Simple and intuitive API
- **Customizable**: Fully customizable themes
- **Fast**: Built with performance in mind
```

## Configure navigation

Update your `site.config.json` file to include your new guide:

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    // ... existing navigation
    {
      "group": "Guides",
      "pages": [
        "guides/my-first-guide"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deploy

When you're ready to deploy, build your documentation site:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with your static site ready to be deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
