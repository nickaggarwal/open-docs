# Introduction to Open Docs

Welcome to Open Docs, a modern documentation site built with React, TypeScript, Material UI, and MDX. This guide will help you get started with creating your own documentation site.

## What is Open Docs?

Open Docs is a documentation framework that allows you to create beautiful, responsive, and feature-rich documentation websites with ease. It combines the power of React for UI components, TypeScript for type safety, Material UI for styling, and MDX for writing content.

## Key Features

- **MDX Support**: Write documentation in Markdown with JSX components for interactive content.
- **Material UI**: Beautiful and responsive UI components that follow Material Design guidelines.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code for better developer experience and fewer bugs.
- **Fast & Responsive**: Optimized for speed and works great on all devices and screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in support for light and dark themes.
- **Search**: Full-text search functionality to help users find content quickly.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the look and feel to match your brand.

## Getting Started

To get started with Open Docs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-docs.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd open-docs
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
open-docs/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── theme/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── ...
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

- `public/`: Static assets like images, fonts, and the favicon.
- `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
- `src/content/`: MDX files containing the documentation content.
- `src/layouts/`: Layout components for different page types.
- `src/pages/`: React components for different pages.
- `src/theme/`: Theme configuration and context.

## Writing Documentation

Documentation is written in MDX, which allows you to use Markdown syntax along with JSX components. Here's an example:

```mdx
# My Document

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

<Alert severity="info">
  This is an information alert using a Material UI component.
</Alert>

## Code Example

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
}
```

You can create new MDX files in the `src/content/` directory and they will automatically be available as documentation pages.

## Customizing the Theme

Open Docs comes with a customizable theme based on Material UI. You can modify the theme in the `src/theme/theme.ts` file:

```typescript
const lightTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'light',
    primary: {
      main: '#2e8555',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#e6007a',
    },
    // Add more customizations here
  },
});
```

## Deployment

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the optimized production build. You can then deploy this directory to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or AWS S3.
