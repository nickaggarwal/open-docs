## Headers

Headers help structure your content and create a clear hierarchy. Open Docs supports 6 levels of headers:

```md
# H1 - Main title of the page
## H2 - Major sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Smaller subsections
##### H5 - Minor points
###### H6 - Fine details
```

### Best Practices for Headers

- Use only one H1 (`#`) per page
- Maintain a logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Keep headers concise and descriptive
- Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word)

## Text Formatting

### Bold, Italic, and Strikethrough

Open Docs supports common text formatting options:

```md
**Bold text** is used for emphasis
*Italic text* is used for slight emphasis or introducing terms
~~Strikethrough~~ is used to show removed or deprecated content
```

Which renders as:

**Bold text** is used for emphasis  
*Italic text* is used for slight emphasis or introducing terms  
~~Strikethrough~~ is used to show removed or deprecated content

### Combining Formatting

You can combine different text formatting styles:

```md
***Bold and italic***
**Bold with *italic* inside**
```

Which renders as:

***Bold and italic***  
**Bold with *italic* inside**

## Links

### Internal Links

Link to other pages in your documentation using relative paths:

```md
[Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation)
[Learn about configuration](/getting-started/configuration)
```

### External Links

Link to external resources by providing the full URL:

```md
[Open Docs GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/open-docs)
[Learn about MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
```

### Section Links

Link to specific sections within a page using anchor links:

```md
[Jump to Text Formatting](#text-formatting)
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for highlighting important information, quotes, or callouts:

```md
> This is a blockquote. It's great for emphasizing important information.
```

Which renders as:

> This is a blockquote. It's great for emphasizing important information.

### Multi-line Blockquotes

```md
> This is a multi-line blockquote.
>
> It can contain multiple paragraphs, lists, and other markdown elements.
>
> - Item one
> - Item two
```

Which renders as:

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
>
> It can contain multiple paragraphs, lists, and other markdown elements.
>
> - Item one
> - Item two



## Lists

### Unordered Lists

```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
```

Which renders as:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2

### Ordered Lists

```md
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Nested step 1
   2. Nested step 2
```

Which renders as:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Nested step 1
   2. Nested step 2

## Horizontal Rules

Use three hyphens to create a horizontal divider:

```md
---
```

Which creates a line like this:

## Callout Components

This guide demonstrates the various callout components available in Open Docs. Callouts are used to draw attention to important information, warnings, tips, and other notes to the reader.

## Using the Callout Component Directly

<Callout type="success">
  This is a success message!
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  This is an error message.
</Callout>

## Using Callouts in Your Documentation

Callouts can be used anywhere in your MDX content like this:

## Styling Guidelines

- Use callouts sparingly to avoid overwhelming the reader
- Choose the appropriate callout type for your message
- Keep callout content concise and directly relevant
- Use formatting (bold, code blocks, etc.) within callouts for better readability
